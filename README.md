# Privacy

Privacy is a fundamental right that most people waive. Beyond the obvious social media, below are some ways to manage your privacy.

## General

If you're in the US, your name/address/phone/email/phone/SSN and likely other records have [been stolen](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535#:~:text=This%20breach%20allegedly%20exposed%20up,to%20help%20you%20stay%20safe.) and unfortunately sold for identity theft or to gain access to your accounts. While there's little you can do about data on a third party background check service, you can be aware of what data you share and how you protect it.

### Passwords and MFA

Don't use the same passwords over and over again. Use the built-in Apple/Google/Microsoft services to generate/save your passwords. I use BitWarden, but there are others.
Use MFA at least on your password vault and main email. Really any service that contains sensitive informaion (credit card, bank, doctor portal) should be protected with MFA and a strong password.

### Delete Old Accounts

You probably have dozens (maybe hundreds) of accounts created across the internet. If you don't use a service I would delete it. If they get breached that information will be sold. You may have to login and hunt for it. It's mostly hidden. If you don't have any luck, google `delete account SERVICE_NAME`. JustDelete.me was a pretty good service at one time, but I haven't used it in awhile. Looks kind of spammy now, but the links I tried mostly worked, did get some 404s.

Physical mail is mostly junk, but that data is stored electronically somewhere. You can remove yourself from pre screened credit card offers and general bulk mail. 

| Service | What it does | Link |
|---|---|---|
| DMAchoice | Opt out of physical mail marketing. You have to pay them $5 to be removed for 10 years. It works and it's worth it. | https://www.dmachoice.org |
| OptOutPresceen | Opt-out of prescreened credit card offers. | https://www.optoutprescreen.com (or call 888-567-8688) |
| Unroll.me | Makes it easier to unsubscribe from mailing lists. I used it, then deleted my account. | https://unroll.me/ |

## iPhone

These settings get moved based on the version of iOS. These are based on iOS 18.2

Open Settings, then

Wi-Fi
| Setting | What it does | Action |
